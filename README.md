# PRODIGY_SD_03
A Java program for managing contacts, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts. Each contact includes a name, phone number, and email. The program stores contacts in memory and offers a simple, user-friendly interface for managing personal or professional contact information. Developed during my ProDigy Infotech internship.
